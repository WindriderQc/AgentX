=== DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP NEEDED ===

Issues:
1. References to NON-EXISTENT files (schema.sql, db.js)
2. FOUR redundant SUMMARY docs (50KB overlap!)
3. THREE architecture docs (could be ONE)
4. Outdated V1/V2-only content (needs V3 updates)

Current: 13 docs, ~4700 lines
Goal: 6 core docs, ~2000 lines (57% reduction)

Recommended Actions:
☐ Update README.md - add V3 features
☐ Consolidate: DELIVERY + IMPLEMENTATION + V3_IMPLEMENTATION → single IMPLEMENTATION.md
☐ Consolidate: 3 ARCHITECTURE docs → single ARCHITECTURE.md
☐ Update API_DOCS.md - add V3 RAG endpoints
☐ Archive: INTEGRATION_SUMMARY, BACKEND_README, INDEX
☐ Fix: Remove references to schema.sql, db.js

Core Docs to Keep:
✓ README.md (update)
✓ QUICKSTART.md (good)
✓ API_DOCS.md (needs V3)
✓ V3_CONTRACT_SNAPSHOT.md (perfect)
+ ARCHITECTURE.md (consolidate)
+ IMPLEMENTATION.md (consolidate)
